# ZepC - the ZeptoN Echo Transcompiler. 

Compiles ZeptoN ".zep" files in to Java bytecode or ".class" files that can execute on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

About
=============================

ZepC is a simpler transcompiler, it uses WEJAC https://wgilreath.github.io/WEJAC/ as its basis. I was motivated to develop ZeptoN  and the ZepC transcompiler for a tool that has fewer compiler options. I developed ZeptoN as a simpler programming language than Java that uses Java features, syntax so minimal difficulty in using ZeptoN or Java.

Features
========

* Simplicity with fewer compiler command-line options
* Java cross-platform bytecode for (macOS/Linux/Windows) 
* Uses underlying Java compiler through Java Compiler API
* Java source code is open-source
* Pre-built JDK11 compatible bytecode binary JAR file
* Transcompiler is one Java class of approximately less than 600 lines of code
* Licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPL) v. 3.0
