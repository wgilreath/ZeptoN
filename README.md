# Zep - the ZeptoN Echo Transcompiler. 

Compiles ZeptoN ".zep" files in to Java bytecode or ".class" files that can execute on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

About
=============================

Zep is a simpler transcompiler, it uses [WEJAC](https://wgilreath.github.io/WEJAC/) as its basis. I was motivated to develop ZeptoN  and the ZepC transcompiler for a tool that has fewer compiler options. I developed ZeptoN as a simpler programming language than Java that uses Java features, syntax so minimal difficulty in using ZeptoN or Java.

Features
========

* Simplicity with fewer compiler command-line options
* Java cross-platform bytecode for (macOS/Linux/Windows) 
* Uses underlying Java compiler through Java Compiler API
* Java source code is open-source
* Pre-built JDK8 compatible bytecode binary JAR file for version 1.0.3. [Download](https://github.com/wgilreath/ZeptoN/raw/master/ZepC.jdk8.jar)
* Transcompiler is one Java class of approximately less than 900 lines of code (including comments)
* Learn to write Java code with a program instead of class, object
